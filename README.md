# RegistryCompare

This Powershell script will take 2 Registry hives, compare them, and return any differences in CSV format. 

I've included 2 Sample registry files: Before.reg and After.reg as well as copies of those files in the Sample Registry folder.

If you cloned this and ran the script it will look for those files in c:\Git\RegistryCompare you can feel free to change the file location variables at the top of the script. It will also make copies with "-orig" appended. 

In the future I'd like to make this all a bit more user friendly but here it is for now.
